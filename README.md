# HTTPServer
[C] HTTP 1.0 Server


## The File That I Attached
In addition to the "C Program", I also attach the "Node.js" version.

But the "Node.js" version is HTTP1.1.

So you can use "wireshark" to compare their packets.


## How To Execute Them
* If you want execute "httpserver.c".

  > You can enter the following commands on your terminal:

   1. "gcc -g -Wall httpserver.c -o httpserver -lpthread"

   2. "sudo ./httpserver"


* If you want to execute "HTTP.js"

  > You can enter the following command:

   1. "sudo node HTTP.js"
